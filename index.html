<p>-> I am currently:</p>

<p>-> learning programming in general

    -> (without a hugely strong goal or necessary direction)

    -> (sometimes just for fun or out of interest)</p>

<p>-> increasing income

    -> (housing, computer repair, online work, writing, blockchain)

-> working on some medical issues</p>

<p>-> if you come across my page, and you want anything from me, or to give or help me in some way, this is what I would like / am looking for / need:
    -> money:
        -> my patreon
    -> jobs that I would be interested in taking:
        -> online english teaching (or in person)
        -> parttime programming gigs, to help you build or solve various problems
    -> share my articles
    -> donate or invest in my (entrepreneurship) projects:</p>

<p>-> If you want to know about other things I am up to:
    -> These are my Stack Overflow answers
    -> a description of a / my technostress disorder (*some documentation for anybody who wants to know about it since there is not a lot of information about my condition available right now)
    -> Here is my GitHub
    -> Here is an about me
    -> here are some photos
    -> here is various documentation on various things i am learning
        -> prompting chatGPT is both a surprisingly rich and complicated topic which can be enormously beneficail but is also quite complicated to analyze. it is powerful, but will take a long tiem to undrestand more smoothly.
    -> here are various things I recommend
    -> here are some thoughts / articles / writings I am developing (philosophical, scientific in character)
    -> here are some of my views, on things (tentantive, in development, always subject to change)
    -> here are some houses I am renting out
    -> what I am currently up to / how I am doing
    -> actual projects i am working on
        -> diy blockchain built mesh networks
        -> compendious amounts of self-harvested data from the internet on [wikidata]
        -> improving my stack overflow content
        -> exploring theoretical questions in foundational questions in linguistics (and the philosophy of mathematics)
        -> above all, trying to make use of blockchain, AI, information, and research, to increase the quality of life that people can have, independently, without depending on highly removed governments or systems that they have no clear, direct personal feedback with or from</p>
    -> Open Questions that I have (in case anybody wants to resolve any of them):
        -> is there any way to get medical consultation, advice, diagnoses, prescriptions, etc, conveninetly and in real time, via the command line, and via open source software? if not, does anything come the closest to that option of unviersal accessiblity and convenience, for medicine? if not, i am goig to try to build one. (the way the current medical system works is not free and is one of the most gigantic lacks of freedom of activity, feeling, access, knowledge, choice, and behavior in modern society that unfountealy is not talked very much about, people are not aware of how almost authoritatianally restritive it i: merely for the reason that they do not ahe the right to exercise their will, almost at all. medical systems are deeply dissatisfying becaus they do not render choice as a customer feature, with patients. therefore, modern medican is a sociologcal, instituional failure and a grievance (form a politiocal and philsophical perspective).)

- why you should only ever use open source. the longterm goal of life is for all of huamnity to become "open source" - not just code, or finormation, but the means to live, freely, happily, and freely (that is, both senses of the word "free"). Italics Open source is a philosophy of freedom.
