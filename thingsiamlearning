some things i am learning right now







this is a huge catalogue of tutorials on various topics i have exposure / am familiar with:

1. Vercel

2. VS Code (seems nice, but not my favorite tool in the long run due to its feature-over-richness, unexpected obscurity and ultimately lack of deep and easy customizability, in spite of appearances)

3. Finding property; renting a house

4. Storing your money as crypto (or better still, as digitally automatic assets, in general) (<- + a minor theory of economics, specifically, "what is money? do you need it? how to get some of it?" What is money.
