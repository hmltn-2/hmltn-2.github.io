Today: tired, minorly tranquil, minorly sad-bitter, minorly wistful-emotional, just slightly melancholic, a bit afflictive and a little background-anxious, somewhat focused and energetic yet minorly lacking in motivation, feeling slightly confused or lost a little bit; tired, lying in bed, early afternoon, haven't eaten yet, running out of important things like medicine, not likely money, but still, always a little worried in the back of my mind, of running out, yet somehow not having the motivation, having the aversion, to not do the really unpleasant or annoying things to offset those problems, but instead preferring to do the things that carry me forward pleasantly, except whichs sometime dally and take longer than they need to in order to become reliable sources of self-support and happiness.

Snowy.

Snow outside my window.
